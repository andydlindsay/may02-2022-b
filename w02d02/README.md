# W02D02 - Asynchronous Control Flow

### To Do
* [x] Blocking Code
* [x] Asynchronous Programming
* [x] `setTimeout` and `setInterval`
* [x] File System Functions (`fs`)

### Async & Sync
* sync - one line executes at a time; after the line before it has run
* async - some of the code steps out of the way to be executed later

* async funcs do NOT have return values


```js
const name = 'Alice';
console.log(name);
```
