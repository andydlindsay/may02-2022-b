### To Do
- [x] Jest vs Cypress
- [x] Install and Configure Cypress
- [x] Design End-to-End Tests with Cypress

Jest
* command line test runner
* cheap
* unit/integration and testing assertion

Cypress
* runs all tests in a browser
* expensive
* end-to-end test our apps holistically; few assertions
