# W10D01 - Rails Review

### To Do
- [x] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources

### Rails Week Convo
* thought it was good (overall prefer JS)
* wish that JS had a generator (sails)
* sometimes hard to see what is implicit (too much magic)
* great when known well; not so great when learning
* prefer having more manual control
* convention over configuration

### MVC
* Model - database
* View - template (ERB)
* Controller - business logic; route logic; brains of the operation
