# W01D03 - Objects in JS

### To Do
- [x] Review primitive types
- [x] Objects!
- [x] Passing primitives and objects to functions
- [x] Functions inside objects (using `this`)
- [x] Object iteration with `for..in`

### Primitives
* primitives are stored directly in memory
* immutable/ cannot be changed after they are set

```js
const str = 'string';
const num = 42;
const bool = true;
const undef = undefined;
const null = null;

const sym = Symbol('symbol');
const bigInt = 42n;
```

### Data Structures
* collections of primitives

```js
const arr = [];
const obj = {};
```

CS50 

If you know the name of the key, use dot notation `user.username`
If the key is unknown (in a variable), use square bracket notation


Objects = describe a particular thing (`user`, `puppy`)
Arrays = collections of things (`users`, `puppies`)

Primitives are passed by value (which means you get a copy not the original)
Objects are passed by reference (which means you get the original not a copy)
